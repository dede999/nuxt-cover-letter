      This is a tool I've built in order to exercise myself, building a cover letter
      with Nuxt JS. The original idea has been built by Oluwafemi Akinyemi on an article
      <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/blog/cover-letter-app-nextjs-chatgpt">
        <b>in this link</b>.
      </a>
    </p>
    <p class="p-5 text-xl text-center">
      I do not intend to monetize from it, as it wasn't my idea, but someone else's. The reason
      I'm asking for an identification is that I'm using a Chat GPT free tier, and I don't want
      to have problems with the API limit
